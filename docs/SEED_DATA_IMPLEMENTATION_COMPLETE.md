## Key Principles Followed

1. **Real-World Authenticity**: All examples based on actual D/s practices from research
2. **Editable Examples**: Users can modify or delete all seed data
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each module has 5-15+ examples
4. **Kevin-Informed**: Respects dominant-driven, self-declared state, transparency
5. **Educational Value**: Examples teach proper D/s relationship management

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test Seed Data**: Run migration and verify all data loads correctly
2. **Create User Guides**: Write documentation for each module (see `docs/guides/`)
3. **UI Testing**: Verify seed data displays correctly in UI
4. **User Feedback**: Gather feedback on seed data usefulness
