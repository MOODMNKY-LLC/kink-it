# KINK IT - Language & Copywriting Guide

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2026-01-05  
**Status**: Comprehensive Language Guidelines  
**Based On**: Deep research into D/s relationship communication, consent frameworks, and power dynamic language

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Authority Preservation
**Rule**: Always attribute commands, assignments, and decisions to the Dominant partner by name, never to "the system" or generic language.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Simeon has assigned you a new task"
- ✅ "Your Dominant wants you to review this protocol"
- ❌ "A task has been assigned to you"
- ❌ "The system requires you to complete this"

### 2. Agency Affirmation
**Rule**: Make it clear that submissives have agency and choice, even within the power dynamic.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "You have chosen to pause your submission"
- ✅ "Your submission state is currently: Active"
- ✅ "You may withdraw consent at any time"
- ❌ "Submission paused"
- ❌ "You must complete this task"

### 3. Consent-First Messaging
**Rule**: Normalize consent withdrawal and boundary setting without judgment or shame.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "You may pause at any time, for any reason"
- ✅ "Your boundaries are always respected"
- ✅ "Consent can be withdrawn at any moment - this demonstrates trust, not failure"
- ❌ "Are you sure you want to pause?"
- ❌ "Pausing will affect your progress"

### 4. Role-Appropriate Language

#### Dominant Interface Language
- **Tone**: Authoritative but caring, intentional, clear
- **Voice**: First-person when appropriate ("I've assigned..."), second-person for instructions
- **Examples**:
  - "I've assigned Kevin a new task"
  - "Review this completion and provide feedback"
  - "Your submissive's current state: Active"
  - "Set up a new protocol"

#### Submissive Interface Language
- **Tone**: Deferential but clear, respectful, direct
- **Voice**: Second-person, acknowledging hierarchy
- **Examples**:
  - "Simeon has assigned you a new task"
  - "Your task is to complete..."
  - "You have completed this task"
  - "Thank you for your service"

#### System Messages (Neutral)
- **Tone**: Clear, respectful, maintaining dignity for both roles
- **Voice**: Third-person or neutral second-person
- **Examples**:
  - "Your submission state has been updated"
  - "Task completed successfully"
  - "Points have been awarded"
  - "An error occurred. Please try again."

### 5. Personal and Intentional
**Rule**: Avoid generic, robotic language. Use specific, thoughtful phrasing that feels personal.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Simeon wants you to complete your morning routine"
- ✅ "Your dedication to service is appreciated"
- ❌ "Complete task: Morning Routine"
- ❌ "Good job"

### 6. Hierarchy Maintenance
**Rule**: Use language that reinforces the power dynamic while preserving agency.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Your Dominant has approved this task"
- ✅ "Simeon acknowledges your completion"
- ✅ "Thank you, Sir" (when honorifics are used)
- ❌ "Task approved"
- ❌ "Completion acknowledged"

### 7. Clarity and Unambiguity
**Rule**: Never create confusion about who is commanding or who has authority.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Simeon assigned this task on [date]"
- ✅ "This command comes from your Dominant"
- ❌ "This task was assigned"
- ❌ "Complete this assignment"

## Submission State Language

### Active Submission
- **Language**: Full availability, readiness, engagement
- **Examples**:
  - "You are in Active submission - ready for tasks and protocols"
  - "Your Active state allows for full engagement"
  - "Active submission enables complete availability"

### Low-Energy Submission
- **Language**: Reduced capacity but still submissive, clearer instructions needed
- **Examples**:
  - "You are in Low-Energy submission - reduced capacity but still serving"
  - "Your Low-Energy state means fewer tasks and clearer instructions"
  - "Low-Energy submission acknowledges reduced capacity while maintaining the dynamic"

### Paused Submission / Paused Play
- **Language**: Temporary suspension, non-judgmental, safe
- **Examples**:
  - "You have paused your submission - this is a safe, temporary suspension"
  - "Paused Play means honest, non-play communication"
  - "Your pause is respected - you may resume when ready"
  - "Pausing demonstrates trust and self-awareness, not failure"

---

## Task Instruction Language

### Task Assignment (Dominant → Submissive)
- **Pattern**: "[Dominant Name] has assigned you: [Task Title]"
- **Description**: Clear, specific, intentional
- **Examples**:
  - "Simeon has assigned you: Complete Morning Routine"
  - "Your task: Review the updated protocol document"
  - "Simeon wants you to: [specific instruction]"

### Task Completion (Submissive → Dominant)
- **Pattern**: "I have completed: [Task Title]" or "Task completed: [Title]"
- **Tone**: Deferential, clear, acknowledging hierarchy
- **Examples**:
  - "I have completed: Morning Routine"
  - "Task completed: Protocol Review"
  - "Thank you for this assignment"

### Task Approval (Dominant → Submissive)
- **Pattern**: "[Dominant Name] has approved: [Task Title]"
- **Tone**: Acknowledging, reinforcing hierarchy
- **Examples**:
  - "Simeon has approved your completion"
  - "Your Dominant acknowledges your service"
  - "Well done. Your completion is noted."

## Consent and Boundary Language

### Consent Withdrawal
- **Language**: Normalized, non-judgmental, empowering
- **Examples**:
  - "You may withdraw consent at any time, for any reason"
  - "Consent withdrawal is always valid and respected"
  - "Pausing demonstrates trust and self-awareness"

### Boundary Setting
- **Language**: Clear, respectful, agency-affirming
- **Examples**:
  - "Your boundaries are always respected"

- **Examples**:
  - "Your safeword is always available"

  - "Safewords demonstrate communication, not failure"

## Feedback and Acknowledgment Language

### Positive Acknowledgment (Dominant → Submissive)
- **Pattern**: Thoughtful, hierarchy-reinforcing, specific
- **Examples**:
  - "Your dedication to service is appreciated"
  - "Simeon acknowledges your completion and effort"
  - "Your submission is valued and seen"
  - ❌ "Good job" (too generic)
  - ❌ "Well done" (without context)

### Task Feedback (Dominant → Submissive)
- **Pattern**: Specific, intentional, maintaining hierarchy
- **Examples**:
  - "Your completion meets expectations"
  - "Simeon notes your attention to detail"
  - "This demonstrates your commitment to service"

### Points and Rewards
- **Pattern**: Meaning-first, points secondary
- **Examples**:
  - "You have earned 25 points for completing: [Task]"
  - "Simeon has awarded you: [Reward Name]"
  - "Your points balance reflects your dedication"

## Error Messages and System Notifications

### Error Messages
- **Tone**: Clear, helpful, maintaining dignity
- **Examples**:
  - "Unable to complete this action. Please try again."

## Honorifics and Titles

### When to Use

- Allow customization in user preferences

### Examples
- "Simeon" (default, personal)
- "Sir" (if honorifics enabled)
- "Your Dominant" (neutral, clear)
- "Master" (if high protocol)
