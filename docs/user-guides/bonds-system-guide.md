## Introduction

The Bonds System allows you to create or join relationship groups (called "bonds") that connect members of your D/s dynamic. Bonds support various relationship structures from simple two-person dyads to complex multi-member polycules and households.

## What is a Bond?

A **bond** is a relationship group that connects members of your D/s dynamic. Think of it as your "relationship unit" - it can be:

- **Dyad**: A two-person relationship (traditional D/s pair)
- **Polycule**: A multi-person polyamorous network
- **Household**: A traditional leather family/household structure
- **Dynamic**: A flexible power exchange dynamic
