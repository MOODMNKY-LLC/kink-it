## Dynamic Intensity

### Casual

Power exchange happens occasionally during scenes or play sessions. The dynamic is not integrated into daily life.

**Best for**: People exploring BDSM, scene-based play, occasional kink activities

### Part-Time

Power exchange happens regularly but not constantly. There are clear boundaries between "dynamic time" and "regular time."

**Best for**: People who want regular BDSM but maintain separate daily lives

### Lifestyle

Power exchange is integrated into daily life but not constant. The dynamic influences everyday decisions and interactions.

**Best for**: People who want D/s to be part of their identity and daily experience

### 24/7

Full-time power exchange where the dynamic is always active. The power exchange extends to all aspects of life.

**Best for**: Experienced practitioners seeking total power exchange
