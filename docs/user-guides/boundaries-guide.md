## Hard Limits vs Soft Limits

### Hard Limits

**Definition**: Activities you never want to explore under any circumstances.

**Examples**:
- Permanent damage or scarring
- Public humiliation (without explicit consent)
- Suspension bondage (fear of heights)
- Age play (not your dynamic)

**Important**: Hard limits are non-negotiable. Partners must respect them unconditionally. Pressuring someone about hard limits is a red flag.

### Soft Limits

**Definition**: Activities you're curious about but need discussion and specific conditions before trying.

**Examples**:
- Heavy impact play (need to start light)
- Extended orgasm denial (curious but nervous)
- Public play (interested but need privacy)
- Wax play (willing with proper safety)

**Important**: Soft limits can evolve with trust and communication. Discuss what would make you comfortable.
