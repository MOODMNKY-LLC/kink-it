## Introduction

The Contracts & Consent module helps you create, manage, and version your D/s covenant (contract). A covenant is a living document that formalizes your agreements, boundaries, and expectations. It serves as a communication tool and reference point for your dynamic.

---

## What Is a Covenant?

A **covenant** (also called a contract) is a written agreement between partners that outlines:
- Roles and responsibilities
- Rules and protocols
- Limits and boundaries
- Safewords and signals
- Communication expectations
- Review cadence

**Important**: A covenant is a tool for communication and structure, not a legal contract. It supports your dynamic but doesn't replace ongoing consent.

## Troubleshooting

### "Covenant Feels Too Formal"

**Problem**: Covenant feels like a legal document rather than a relationship tool.

**Solution**:
- Use personal language
- Focus on relationship, not legality
- Keep it conversational
- Remember it's a tool, not a contract

### "Partner Won't Sign"

**Problem**: Submissive hesitant to sign covenant.

**Solution**:
- Discuss concerns openly
- Address specific worries
- Modify terms if needed
- Don't pressure - consent is key

### "Need to Change Terms"

**Problem**: Covenant needs updates but already signed.

**Solution**:
- Create new version
- Discuss changes together
- Both sign new version
- Archive old version
