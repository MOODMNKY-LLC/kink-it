## Introduction

Safety and consent are the foundation of healthy BDSM/kink relationships. This guide outlines essential safety practices, consent frameworks, and how KINK IT supports safe play.

---

## Core Safety Frameworks

### SSC: Safe, Sane, and Consensual

**Safe**: Activities should be as free from harm as possible. This means:
- Understanding risks involved
- Using proper safety equipment
- Knowing how to perform activities safely
- Having emergency plans

**Sane**: Activities should be engaged in with clear judgment:
- No impairment (alcohol, drugs, etc.)
- Mental clarity and awareness
- Understanding of what you're doing
- Ability to make informed decisions

**Consensual**: All parties must agree:
- Explicit, enthusiastic consent
- No coercion or pressure
- Ability to withdraw consent at any time
- Clear communication about boundaries

### RACK: Risk-Aware Consensual Kink

RACK acknowledges that some kink activities involve inherent risks. Participants should:
- Be fully aware of potential dangers
- Understand risks before engaging
- Make informed decisions
- Accept responsibility for risks

### PRICK: Personal Responsibility, Informed, Consensual Kink

PRICK emphasizes:
- **Personal Responsibility**: Each person is responsible for their own safety
- **Informed**: Full understanding of activities and risks
- **Consensual**: Clear, ongoing consent

## Setting Limits

### Hard Limits

**Hard limits** are activities you will **never** do under any circumstances. Examples:
- Specific activities you find triggering
- Activities that violate your values
- Activities that cause physical or emotional harm
- Activities you're not ready for

**In KINK IT**: Set hard limits in your profile settings. These are non-negotiable.

### Soft Limits

**Soft limits** are activities you might be willing to try under certain conditions:
- Activities you're curious about but hesitant
- Activities that require specific circumstances
- Activities you want to explore gradually

**In KINK IT**: Set soft limits in your profile. These can be revisited with communication.

## Safewords

### What is a Safeword?

A **safeword** is a pre-agreed word or signal used to:
- **Stop** play immediately
- **Pause** to check in
- **Slow down** or adjust intensity

### Common Safeword Systems

**Traffic Light System**:
- 🟢 **Green**: Everything is good, continue
- 🟡 **Yellow**: Slow down, ease up, check in
- 🔴 **Red**: Stop immediately

**Stoplight System**:
- **Green**: All good
- **Yellow**: Ease up
- **Red**: Stop now

**Custom Safewords**:
- Choose words that are:
  - Easy to remember
  - Unlikely to come up during play
  - Clear and unambiguous

### Non-Verbal Safewords

If you might become non-verbal:
- **Drop object**: Hold something you can drop
- **Hand signal**: Pre-agreed gesture
- **Tap out**: Physical signal (like martial arts)

---

## Negotiation

### Before Any Scene

1. **Discuss Activities**: What will happen?
2. **Set Limits**: Hard and soft limits
3. **Establish Safewords**: Agree on stop/pause words
4. **Discuss Aftercare**: What's needed after?
5. **Health Considerations**: Any medical issues?
6. **Check Equipment**: Is everything safe?

### Ongoing Communication

- **Regular Check-ins**: How are you feeling?
- **Re-negotiation**: Limits can change
- **Feedback**: What worked? What didn't?
- **Boundary Respect**: Honor all limits

---

## Aftercare

### What is Aftercare?

**Aftercare** is care provided after a scene to help participants:
- Come down from intense states
- Process emotions
- Feel safe and cared for
- Return to baseline

### Common Aftercare Needs

- **Physical**: Water, food, warmth, comfort
- **Emotional**: Reassurance, praise, connection
- **Space**: Time to process, quiet, cuddles
- **Communication**: Discussion, debrief, feedback

### In KINK IT

Track aftercare preferences in your profile. Partners can see what you need.
