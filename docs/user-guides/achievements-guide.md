## Introduction

The Achievements system recognizes consistency, growth, and milestones in your dynamic. Achievements are presence-based (not autopilot) and linked to Dominant engagement, ensuring recognition feels meaningful and reinforces your dynamic rather than feeling like gamification.

---

## What Are Achievements?

**Achievements** are milestones and badges that recognize:
- Task completion consistency
- Check-in consistency
- Point milestones
- Growth and development
- Special accomplishments

**Key Principle**: Achievements are presence-based, meaning they're unlocked through actual engagement with your Dominant, not automated systems. This ensures recognition feels meaningful and reinforces authority.
