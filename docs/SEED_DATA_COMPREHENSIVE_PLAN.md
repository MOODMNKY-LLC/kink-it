# Comprehensive Seed Data Implementation Plan
## All 12 Modules - Real-World Examples & Documentation

**Date**: 2026-02-15  
**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Purpose**: Create comprehensive seed data and example content for all 12 modules to provide users with real-world context and starting points

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to create seed data, example content, and user guides for all 12 modules of the KINK IT application. The goal is to provide users with realistic, editable examples that demonstrate proper D/s relationship practices while respecting core principles: dominant-driven execution, self-declared submission states, transparency by default, anti-autopilot mechanisms, and low-friction UX.
