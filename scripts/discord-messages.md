🎉 **KINK IT Discord Server Setup Complete!**

Welcome to your KINK IT notification and communication hub. This server is designed to support your D/s dynamic with automated notifications and optional communication channels.

**Important Principles:**
- **Authority Preservation**: All notifications attribute actions to your Dominant partner by name, never to "the system"
- **Consent-First**: Language normalizes boundary setting and consent withdrawal
- **Role-Appropriate**: Messages are tailored to each role's perspective

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the server structure in #server-info
2. Configure your notification preferences
3. Assign roles to members (@Dominant, @Submissive, @Switch)

**Notification Channels:**
All notification channels are read-only and receive automated messages from the KINK IT application. You can customize which channels you receive notifications for in your app settings.

For detailed setup instructions, see the documentation in your KINK IT repository.

# KINK IT Discord Server Rules

## Core Principles

1. **Authority Preservation**: This server supports your D/s dynamic but never replaces human authority. You obey your Dominant partner, not software.

2. **Consent-First**: Consent can be withdrawn at any time, for any reason. This demonstrates trust, not failure.

3. **Privacy**: This server is private to your dynamic. Do not share content outside your relationship without explicit consent.

4. **Respect**: Maintain appropriate hierarchy and tone in all communications.

## Channel Guidelines

- **Notification Channels**: Read-only. Do not post manually.
- **Communication Channels**: Use for discussion, check-ins, and support.
- **Resource Channels**: Share educational content and ideas.

## NSFW Content

This server may contain NSFW content related to D/s dynamics. All members must be 18+ and consent to viewing such content.

## Support

For technical issues or questions, contact your server administrator or refer to the KINK IT app documentation.
