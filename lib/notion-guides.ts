KINK IT is a relationship management application designed for Dominants and submissives to manage their dynamic with care, consent, and communication at the core.

## What is KINK IT?

KINK IT helps D/s couples:

- **Track tasks and protocols** - Dominants can assign tasks, submissives can complete them
- **Manage meaningful rewards** - Recognition based on the five love languages
- **Explore boundaries safely** - Yes/No/Maybe lists and boundary documentation
- **Maintain consent** - Contracts, scene negotiations, and safe words
- **Communicate effectively** - Check-ins, debriefs, and journaling
- **Track progress** - Analytics on tasks, moods, and relationship growth

## Getting Started

### For Dominants

1. **Set up your profile** - Add your preferences and communication style
2. **Create initial rules** - Establish protocols and expectations
3. **Define rewards** - What recognition matters to your submissive?
4. **Assign first tasks** - Start with simple daily protocols
5. **Open communication** - Regular check-ins build trust

### For Submissives

1. **Complete your profile** - Share your limits and preferences
2. **Review rules** - Understand expectations and protocols
3. **Explore boundaries** - Fill out your Yes/No/Maybe list
4. **Complete tasks** - Build your streak and earn recognition
5. **Communicate openly** - Share how you're feeling regularly

## Core Principles

> **Consent is ongoing** - All activities require enthusiastic, informed consent that can be withdrawn at any time.

> **Communication is essential** - Regular check-ins, honest discussions, and active listening strengthen the dynamic.

> **Safety comes first** - Physical, emotional, and mental safety are non-negotiable.

> **Respect boundaries** - Hard limits are absolute. Soft limits require careful negotiation.`,

    content: `# Rules & Protocols Guide

Rules and protocols form the foundation of your D/s dynamic. They provide structure, security, and clear expectations for both partners.

## Understanding Rules

### What are Rules?

Rules are behavioral expectations established by the Dominant that guide the submissive's conduct. They can range from daily protocols to situational guidelines.

**Key characteristics of effective rules:**
- **Clear and specific** - No ambiguity about expectations
- **Achievable** - Within the submissive's capabilities
- **Meaningful** - Serve the dynamic and relationship goals
- **Consensual** - Agreed upon by both partners
- **Reviewable** - Can be modified as the dynamic evolves

## Types of Rules

### Standing Rules

These are always-active protocols that apply regardless of context.

**Examples:**
- Daily morning check-in by 9 AM
- Use respectful titles (Sir, Daddy, Master, etc.)
- Ask permission before making major purchases
- Maintain sleep schedule (in bed by 11 PM)
- Send photo proof of meals eaten

### Situational Rules

These apply only in specific contexts or locations.

**Examples:**
- **Public behavior** - No revealing clothing without approval
- **Work hours** - Limited contact except emergencies
- **Social events** - Stay within arm's reach
- **Private time** - Specific greeting rituals when arriving home

### Temporary Rules

Time-limited protocols for training, punishment, or special circumstances.

**Examples:**
- No desserts for one week (health goal)
- Daily journaling for 30 days (communication building)
- Extra check-ins during stressful period
- Limited screen time as consequence

## Creating Effective Protocols

### Communication Protocols

**Daily check-ins:**
- Morning greeting
- Evening report
- Bedtime ritual
- Mood updates using color system (green/yellow/red)

**Speech protocols:**
- Required titles or honorifics
- Permission to speak freely
- Respectful language requirements

## Implementing Rules

### Start Simple

1. **Begin with 3-5 core rules** - Don't overwhelm
2. **Focus on meaningful protocols** - Not arbitrary control
3. **Build gradually** - Add complexity over time
4. **Check in frequently** - Ensure rules serve the dynamic

### Document Everything

Use KINK IT to:
- ✅ Record all active rules
- ✅ Note context and exceptions
- ✅ Track violations and patterns
- ✅ Review and adjust regularly

## Regular Rule Review

### Monthly Check-ins

Review all rules together:

- **What's working?** - Which rules strengthen the dynamic?
- **What's not working?** - Which rules feel arbitrary or burdensome?
- **What's missing?** - Are there gaps in the structure?
- **What needs adjustment?** - How can rules better serve both partners?

### Adapting Over Time

Your dynamic will evolve:

- Life circumstances change
- Trust deepens
- Interests shift
- Needs evolve

**Rules should adapt accordingly** - What worked at 3 months may need adjustment at 3 years.`,

    content: `# Meaningful Rewards System

Meaningful rewards are the heart of positive reinforcement in a D/s dynamic. This guide explains how to use KINK IT's research-based rewards system.

- **Confidence boost** - Validates the submissive's efforts

## The Five Love Languages

KINK IT's rewards system is based on the five love languages. Different submissives value different forms of recognition.

### 1. Words of Affirmation

### 2. Quality Time

## Recognition Tiers

### Daily Recognition

- "Good girl/boy" affirmations
- Small gestures of appreciation

**Why it matters:** Consistent small recognition builds security and motivation.

### Weekly Recognition

**Frequency:** End of week for consistent performance

**Forms:**
- Detailed review of the week's successes
- Choice of activity for weekend
- Extended scene or special time together
- Small meaningful gift or treat

**Why it matters:** Acknowledges sustained effort and builds momentum.

### Monthly Recognition

**Frequency:** End of month for sustained excellence

**Forms:**
- Major reward from submissive's wishlist
- Special date or experience
- New privilege granted

### Milestone Recognition

- Weekend getaway
- Custom scene based on fantasies
- Major gift or experience
- Contract renewal celebration

**Why it matters:** Honors major accomplishments and relationship milestones.

## Using the Point System

### Points are Secondary

> Points track progress but are NOT the primary reward. Meaningful recognition matters most.

**Point values:**
- Simple daily tasks: 5-10 points
- Moderate tasks: 10-20 points
- Challenging tasks: 20-25 points
- Initiative bonuses: 10-50 points
- Weekly streak: 50 points
- Monthly milestone: 100 points

**Redemption options:**
- Choose next scene activity
- Request specific quality time
- Select gift from wishlist
- Trade for small privilege

### Balance is Key

Provide meaningful rewards **regardless of points**. The best recognition comes from genuine appreciation, not point accumulation.

## Best Practices

### Surprise and Delight

Best rewards are often unexpected:
- Random appreciation messages
- Surprise date nights
- Unexpected small gifts
- Spontaneous quality time

### Recognize Effort, Not Just Results

Sometimes submissives try hard but circumstances prevent success. Recognize:
- Genuine effort
- Problem-solving attempts
- Communication about challenges
- Attitude and intention

### Keep it Genuine

Forced or performative praise feels hollow. Only give recognition when:
- You genuinely mean it
- You've noticed specific behaviors
- You're expressing authentic appreciation`,

    title: "Safety & Consent Guide",
    description: "Essential safety practices and consent protocols for ethical BDSM relationships.",
    category: "Critical",
    icon: "🔒",
    content: `# Safety & Consent Guide

Safety and consent are the absolute foundation of ethical BDSM practice. This guide covers essential safety practices and consent protocols.

## Core Consent Principles

### Consent Must Be:

**1. Informed**
- Both partners understand what they're agreeing to
- Risks and expectations are clearly communicated
- Activities are discussed in detail before they occur

**2. Enthusiastic**
- Active agreement, not passive acceptance
- "Yes" not just absence of "no"
- Genuine desire to participate

**3. Ongoing**
- Can be withdrawn at ANY time
- Must be reaffirmed for new activities
- Check-ins during scenes are essential

**4. Specific**
- Consent to one activity doesn't mean consent to all
- Boundaries can be different in different contexts
- Details matter (intensity, duration, specific acts)

## Safe Words & Signals

### Standard Safe Word System

**Red** - FULL STOP immediately
- All activity ceases
- Aftercare begins
- Discussion when both ready

**Yellow** - Slow down or check in
- Reduce intensity
- Communicate what's needed
- Assess if continuing is okay

**Green** - All good, continue
- Used during check-ins
- Confirms enthusiastic consent
- Signals desire to continue

### Non-Verbal Signals

For situations where speech is restricted:

**Options:**
- Hand signals (thumbs up/down)
- Holding an object (drop to stop)
- Humming patterns
- Head nods/shakes
- Finger snaps

**Critical:** Practice and agree on signals before using them in play.

## Types of Boundaries

### Hard Limits

**Definition:** Absolute boundaries that must never be crossed.

**Examples:**
- Specific activities you won't engage in
- Body parts that are off-limits
- Scenarios you find triggering
- Dynamics you're not comfortable with

**Rules:**
- Hard limits are non-negotiable
- Never pressure someone about their hard limits
- Hard limits can be added anytime
- Violating hard limits is abuse

### Soft Limits

**Definition:** Activities you're uncertain about or need special conditions to explore.

**Examples:**
- "I'm curious but nervous"
- "Only in specific contexts"
- "Need to build up to this"
- "Depends on my mood/energy"

**Exploration:**
- Extensive discussion required
- Start very gently
- Frequent check-ins
- Can become hard limits if uncomfortable
- Can become comfortable with time and trust

## Physical Safety

### Impact Play Safety

**Safe zones:**
- Fleshy areas (buttocks, thighs, upper back)
- Avoid kidneys, spine, joints
- Never hit head, neck, or tailbone

**Technique:**
- Start light, build gradually
- Learn proper angles and force
- Watch for excessive bruising
- Stop if skin breaks

### Bondage Safety

**Circulation:**
- Check color and temperature of extremities
- Ask about numbness or tingling
- Release immediately if circulation compromised
- Learn proper rope techniques

**Duration:**
- Don't leave restrained person alone
- Limit time in restrictive positions
- Have safety scissors accessible
- Watch for signs of distress

## Emotional Safety

### Before Scenes

**Check mental state:**
- "How are you feeling emotionally today?"
- "Are you in the right headspace for this?"
- "Any concerns or worries?"
- "What do you need from me?"

### During Scenes

**Regular check-ins:**
- Ask for color (red/yellow/green)
- Observe body language
- Notice changes in breathing or tension
- Maintain awareness of partner's state

### After Scenes (Aftercare)

**Essential:**
- Physical comfort (blankets, water, snacks)
- Emotional reassurance
- Processing the experience
- Reconnection and intimacy
- Time for both partners to recover

## Red Flags and Abuse

### Warning Signs

> **These are NOT acceptable in BDSM:**
> - Ignoring safe words
> - Pressuring to remove limits
> - Isolating from friends/family
> - Financial control or exploitation
> - Threatening to "out" someone
> - Refusing aftercare
> - Gaslighting or manipulation
> - Activities while intoxicated
> - Ignoring withdrawal of consent

### The Difference: BDSM vs. Abuse

**BDSM:**
- Consensual power exchange
- Negotiated boundaries
- Respects limits and safe words
- Provides aftercare
- Builds trust and intimacy
- Can be stopped anytime

**Abuse:**
- Non-consensual control
- Ignores boundaries
- Uses BDSM as excuse
- Leaves partner isolated/afraid
- Damages trust and safety
- Victim feels trapped

---

**Remember:** Safety and consent aren't buzzkills - they're what make BDSM possible. They create the trust and security that allow you to explore together. Never compromise on either.`,
